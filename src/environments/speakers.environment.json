{"alan-watts":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEEQ69tKXft0A4HXdNQjhGDr-","years":"1915-1973","name":"Alan Watts","image":"assets/images/alan-watts.png","bio":"British-American philosopher who interpreted and popularised Eastern philosophy for a Western audience. Born in Chislehurst, England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began Zen training in New York. Pursuing a career, he attended Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, where he received a master's degree in theology. Watts became an Episcopal priest in 1945, then left the ministry in 1950 and moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the American Academy of Asian Studies. Watts gained a large following in the San Francisco Bay Area while working as a volunteer programmer at KPFA, a Pacifica Radio station in Berkeley. Watts wrote more than 25 books and articles on subjects important to Eastern and Western religion, introducing the then-burgeoning youth culture to The Way of Zen (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism.","books":{},"videos":{"XHBKM7mBHUM":"the nature of consciousness part 1","0nCzlkeYuW4":"the nature of consciousness part 2","eIDWW2h8A7A":"the web of life part 1","s8aD_Tch-Bg":"the web of life part 2","FFNzr6qrYs0":"the inevitable ecstasy part 1","lgpQ356nNDA":"the inevitable ecstasy part 2","8PtP1ezKLZA":"the world as just so part 1","jV0EDNkxaTA":"the world as just so part 2","wPEjn72J5gE":"the world as self part 1","Xp-nP4CN3uo":"the world as self part 2","YF-fBXd1c2Q":"the world as emptiness part 1","uCxy0t6Pl3w":"the world as emptiness part 2","5hMROXyxpSE":"the cosmic network (full lecture)"},"quotes":{}},"aldous-huxley":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEEShoB_4UWGibR3xcXFvOkaF","years":"1894-1963","name":"Aldous Huxley","image":"assets/images/aldous-huxley.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"J1LTI2aXMyA":"the mind (powerful talk)"},"quotes":{}},"bruce-lee":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEERyzM_LVk9Vfd7jRuHtqYRV","years":"1940-1973","name":"Bruce Lee","image":"assets/images/bruce-lee.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"y5WJOtw2fDs":"bruce lee, be water my friend","la_D3oF5H_A":"bruce lee radio interview with ted thomas","SncapPrTusA":"bruce lee ping pong (full version)"},"quotes":{}},"buckminster-fuller":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEERL2OCcQkLXFBUdQGVZSAC3","years":"1895-1983","name":"Buckminster Fuller","image":"assets/images/buckminster-fuller.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"z_GjHf4XLxU":"buckminster fuller explains everything"},"quotes":{}},"eckhart-tolle":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEESC7COtAOcgOlAADMixtHCa","years":"1948-Now","name":"Eckhart Tolle","image":"assets/images/eckhart-tolle.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"A1B-_qhG_rM":"the end of ego morning star","X0Yw6wNNx7E":"transcending neediness"},"quotes":{}},"joseph-campbell":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEERb-Rl3T7T1jYZ4JqC5UNAH","years":"1904-1987","name":"Joseph Campbell","image":"assets/images/joseph-campbell.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"TLKUFYAOoRI":"joseph campbell on following your bliss","dFM4KaP-kzU":"the awesome mystery of being","W6xuh8v98r8":"20. an important function of myth: how to live a human life","qlLzAD2oWL8":"22.  what purpose do these myths serve regarding consciousness?","aGx4IlppSgU":"-on becoming an adult","VgOUxICCHoA":"-myth as the mirror for the ego"},"quotes":{}},"kim-eng":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEETc5JLf58oqV19BZe4wUNmX","years":"1980-Now","name":"Kim Eng","image":"assets/images/kim-eng.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"aYD28m0CrUw":"how to deal with loneliness"},"quotes":{}},"mr-rogers":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEEQhSAeU_pzEdUIZqjTvoVSP","years":"1928-2003","name":"Mr. Rogers","image":"assets/images/mr-rogers.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"5BZlyxS37Kk":"it's you i like","p-Kp5YeqrlE":"mister rogers on tonight show (1983)"},"quotes":{}},"osho":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEESSZGwmqswxm4lU75y_IEUp","years":"1931-1990","name":"Osho","image":"assets/images/osho.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"kulGJ5wZSDM":"my whole life is full of jokes","otGQqO2TYMI":"absolutely free to be funny"},"quotes":{}},"ram-dass":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEES7znh5gjoPDApMztgqE4CQ","years":"1931-Now","name":"Ram Dass","image":"assets/images/ram-dass.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"Ir5ydNXpJlA":"being free together | ram dass full lecture","kjh1BAG5Pfs":"sacred in the everyday - ram dass full lecture","U1x5PgqEw4I":"seasons of our lives - ram dass full lecture 1978","XULCcPWVKdk":"pt. 5 methods to consciousness - 1970","GUHaAH-Ahg4":"pt. 8 methods to consciousness - 1970","-I9UdO4sPJ4":"pt. 4 methods to consciousness - 1970","_fcB4KQels4":"pt. 6 methods to consciousness - 1970","1gvA8I87-0U":"pt. 7 methods to consciousness","Xu_jell1qpg":"a gathering of souls - ram dass full lecture 1995","sQZcmzKD1W0":"one man's journey to the east","GMn31VvR6xI":"timothy leary and ram dass debate"},"quotes":{}},"sadhguru":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEERBveg9ODaBymFdvEnG6xZ0","years":"1957-Now","name":"Sadhguru","image":"assets/images/sadhguru.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"LNyJgNjCDuU":"how do you stop the mind's chatter?
