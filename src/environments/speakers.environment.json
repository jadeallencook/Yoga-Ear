{"alan-watts":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEEQ69tKXft0A4HXdNQjhGDr-","years":"1915-1973","name":"Alan Watts","image":"assets/images/alan-watts.png","bio":"British-American philosopher who interpreted and popularised Eastern philosophy for a Western audience. Born in Chislehurst, England, he moved to the United States in 1938 and began Zen training in New York. Pursuing a career, he attended Seabury-Western Theological Seminary, where he received a master's degree in theology. Watts became an Episcopal priest in 1945, then left the ministry in 1950 and moved to California, where he joined the faculty of the American Academy of Asian Studies. Watts gained a large following in the San Francisco Bay Area while working as a volunteer programmer at KPFA, a Pacifica Radio station in Berkeley. Watts wrote more than 25 books and articles on subjects important to Eastern and Western religion, introducing the then-burgeoning youth culture to The Way of Zen (1957), one of the first bestselling books on Buddhism.","books":{},"videos":{"XHBKM7mBHUM":"Alan Watts: The Nature Of Consciousness Part 1","0nCzlkeYuW4":"Alan Watts: The Nature Of Consciousness Part 2","eIDWW2h8A7A":"Alan Watts: The Web Of Life Part 1","s8aD_Tch-Bg":"Alan Watts: The Web Of Life Part 2","FFNzr6qrYs0":"Alan Watts: The Inevitable Ecstasy Part 1","lgpQ356nNDA":"Alan Watts: The Inevitable Ecstasy Part 2","8PtP1ezKLZA":"Alan Watts: The World As Just So Part 1","jV0EDNkxaTA":"Alan Watts: The World As Just So Part 2","wPEjn72J5gE":"Alan Watts: The World As Self Part 1","Xp-nP4CN3uo":"Alan Watts: The World As Self Part 2","YF-fBXd1c2Q":"Alan Watts: The World As Emptiness Part 1","uCxy0t6Pl3w":"Alan Watts: The World As Emptiness Part 2","5hMROXyxpSE":"Alan Watts - The Cosmic Network (FULL LECTURE)"},"quotes":{}},"aldous-huxley":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEEShoB_4UWGibR3xcXFvOkaF","years":"1894-1963","name":"Aldous Huxley","image":"assets/images/aldous-huxley.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"J1LTI2aXMyA":"Aldous Huxley - The Mind (Powerful Talk)"},"quotes":{}},"bruce-lee":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEERyzM_LVk9Vfd7jRuHtqYRV","years":"1940-1973","name":"Bruce Lee","image":"assets/images/bruce-lee.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"y5WJOtw2fDs":"Bruce Lee, Be Water My Friend","la_D3oF5H_A":"Bruce Lee radio interview with Ted Thomas","SncapPrTusA":"Bruce Lee Ping Pong (Full Version)"},"quotes":{}},"buckminster-fuller":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEERL2OCcQkLXFBUdQGVZSAC3","years":"1895-1983","name":"Buckminster Fuller","image":"assets/images/buckminster-fuller.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"z_GjHf4XLxU":"Buckminster Fuller Explains Everything"},"quotes":{}},"eckhart-tolle":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEESC7COtAOcgOlAADMixtHCa","years":"1948-Now","name":"Eckhart Tolle","image":"assets/images/eckhart-tolle.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"A1B-_qhG_rM":"Eckhart tolle - the end of ego morning star","X0Yw6wNNx7E":"Transcending Neediness"},"quotes":{}},"joseph-campbell":{"playlist":"PLkj0Wb8QyEERb-Rl3T7T1jYZ4JqC5UNAH","years":"1904-1987","name":"Joseph Campbell","image":"assets/images/joseph-campbell.png","bio":"","books":{},"videos":{"TLKUFYAOoRI":"Joseph Campbell on Following Your Bliss","dFM4KaP-kzU":"Joseph Campbell - The Awesome Mystery of Being","W6xuh8v98r8":"20.
